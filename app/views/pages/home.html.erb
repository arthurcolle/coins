        <p class="lead">The most difficult part of using Bitcoin is not knowing that your coins are truly secure.

        It is so easy to lose access to our own machines and we all know how inconvenient it is to be in that position. In fact, it is exactly those times that we most need access to our funds, so the Coins team built this app to help you store your coins safely. Far away, locked in a secure remote location is a physical copy of your private keys that not even we have access to.</p>

          <h2>Simple</h2>
          <p>Simplicity is the state or quality of being simple. It usually relates to the burden which a thing puts on someone trying to explain or understand it. Something which is easy to understand or explain is simple, in contrast to something complicated.</p>
          <p>"Simplicity boils down to two steps: Identify the essential. Eliminate the rest." â€“ Leo Babauta</p>

          <h2>Secure</h2>
          <p>Data security means protecting data, such as a database, from destructive forces and the unwanted actions of unauthorized users. In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a way that only authorized parties can read it. Encryption does not of itself prevent interception, but denies the message content to the interceptor. </p>
